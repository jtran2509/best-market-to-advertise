# Finding the best Market to Advertise

## Quick Intro

## Problem Statement
- The dataset is adopted from [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder survey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/), which is based on the responds of more than 31,000 people who have been coding for less than 5 years. The purpose of this project is to determine whether the learners from different countries are willing to spend a specific amount of money per month so that the company can target the ad

## Approach 
- I use Numpy and Pandas to clean the column and determine the location of learners in different countries where there are high interest in web development. Then, I deal with extreme outliers in the top 4 countries to figure out whether the respondents' answer made sense or not

## Result
- Identify top 2 out of 172 countries to target the advertisement after eliminating more than 50% outliers from top 4 countries
